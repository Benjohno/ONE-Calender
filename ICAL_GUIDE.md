# 📅 ICAL Calendar System Guide

## What is ICAL?

ICAL (iCalendar) is a standard format for calendar data that allows you to share calendar information via simple URLs. Unlike CalDAV, ICAL is **read-only** and much simpler to set up - you just need a public calendar URL!

## 🆚 ICAL vs CalDAV

| Feature | ICAL | CalDAV |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Setup Complexity** | ✅ Very Simple | ❌ Complex |
| **Authentication** | ✅ None Required | ❌ Username/Password |
| **Sync Direction** | ✅ Read-Only | ✅ Two-Way |
| **URL Format** | ✅ Public URLs | ❌ Server URLs |
| **Reliability** | ✅ High | ⚠️ Variable |
